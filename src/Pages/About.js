<p style={{fontFamily:"Frankling Gothic Medium" ,fontSize:"20px",paddingLeft:"30px",paddingRight:"30px",paddingBottom:"20px"}}>Whether you have recently purchased your home or have been living there for a while, home maintenance is an unavoidable part of owning a property that if you do right, can ensure that your home remains a safe, secure and cared for environment.

Not only can staying on top of things avoid problems in the long term, but regular maintenance and repairs will provide the opportunity to make minor upgrades that can increase the value of your home, as well as improve on it as a living space.

Home maintenance, in this instance, does not refer to general, everyday tasks such as cleaning and gardening – rather, tasks that may be considered as more of a hassle. This includes things such as:

Checking safety and security features
Maintaining plumbing, heating and other utilities
Carrying out inspection of the structure of the home
Maintaining exterior paint, materials and general aesthetics</p>

<p style={{fontFamily:"Frankling Gothic Medium" ,fontSize:"20px",paddingLeft:"30px",paddingRight:"30px"}}>
Carrying out maintenance tasks sooner rather than later is important for a number of reasons. Firstly, you will ensure that you are living in a safe and functional home, while saving money in the process. In the long run, the avoidance of home maintenance tasks will mean that problems build up, eventually leading to significant damage or safety hazards in the form of poor structural integrity or ineffective safety features like smoke alarms. Furthermore, these problems will cost a significant amount in comparison to the minimal costs associated with regular maintenance and small repairs.

You will also save time and maintain a flexible schedule if you stay on top of your home maintenance duties. While maintenance is able to be scheduled and worked around due to the non-urgent nature of the repairs, waiting for a problem to become more serious will mean that you have to move your schedule around, in order to take care of it as soon as possible.

Additionally, being responsible for the upkeep of the general aesthetics of the inside and outside of your home will retain your homes’ image and atmosphere, resulting in a home that you, your family and visitors can enjoy.

A final point here is that carrying out home maintenance will directly increase the value of your home. Whether you are considering selling your home or planning to stay, maximising the value of your home is important in being prepared for any unexpected changes. Any inspections that are carried out will result in higher valuations in a well maintained home.
